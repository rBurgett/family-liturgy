## Wednesday - The God Who Provides

### The Psalm

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:

*as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.*

### The Reading

A reading from

The word of the Lord

*Thanks be to God.*

### The Canticle

Abraham's son Isaac grew up and married Rebekah.

*They had twin sons named Esau and Jacob.*

Esau was older, but Jacob tricked him into giving up his inheritance.

*Jacob married Leah and her sister Rachel.*

Rachel was Jacob's favorite wife.

*Marriage is supposed to be between one man and one woman.*

Rachel gave birth to Joseph, who was Jacob's favorite son.

*Jacob had twelve sons and one daughter.*

Joseph's brothers were jealous of him.

*They sold him to traders for 20 pieces of silver.*

Joseph was taken to Egypt as a slave.

*But, God was with Joseph.*

Joseph was accused of a crime he did not commit.

*He was thrown into prison.*

God gave Joseph the ability to interpret dreams.

*The Pharaoh made Joseph his chief advisor.*

When a famine came, Joseph's brothers went to Egypt to buy food.

*Joseph forgave his brothers.*

Joseph was able to save his whole family.

*And they all moved to Egypt to be with him.*

Just as Joseph was betrayed for silver pieces and ended up saving his family,

*Many years later, God's promised savior would be betrayed for silver pieces but then save the whole world.*

Amen.

### The Lord's Prayer

*Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.*

### The Collect

Lord God, almighty and everlasting Father, you have brought us in safety to this new day: Preserve us with your mighty power, that we may not fall into sin, nor be overcome by adversity; and in all we do, direct us to the fulfilling of your purpose; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
