## Monday - The Creation

### The Psalm

Psalm 90, verses one and two.

1 Lord, You have been our refuge from one generation to another. 2 Before the mountains were brought forth, or the land and the earth were born, from age to age you are God.

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:

*as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.*

### The Reading

A reading from Genesis 1, verses one through five.

1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 2 Now the earth was without shape and empty, and darkness was over the surface of the watery deep, but the Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the water. 3 God said, "Let there be light." And there was light! 4 God saw that the light was good, so God separated the light from the darkness. 5 God called the light "day" and the darkness "night." There was evening, and there was morning, marking the first day.

The word of the Lord

*Thanks be to God.*

### The Canticle

In the beginning,

*God created the heavens and the earth.*

On the first day, God made light.

*He called the light day and the darkness night*

On the second day, God separated the sky above from the earth below.

*He called sky the heavens.*

On the third day, God separated the land from the water.

*He called the dry land earth and the water seas.*

God covered the earth in plants and trees.

*He saw that it was good!*

On the fourth day, God made the sun, moon, and stars.

*The sun for the day and the moon for the night.*

On the fifth day, God created birds and fish.

*He saw that it was good!*

On the sixth day, God created animals

*He saw that it was good!*

Then, God created humanity in his own image.

*He saw that they were very good!*

He gave them the earth, to rule over and care for.

*Both male and female.*

On the seventh day, God rested.

*God blessed that day and made it holy.*

Amen.

### The Lord's Prayer

[everyone holding hands]

*Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.*

### The Collect

Lord God, almighty and everlasting Father, you have brought us in safety to this new day: Preserve us with your mighty power, that we may not fall into sin, nor be overcome by adversity; and in all we do, direct us to the fulfilling of your purpose; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
