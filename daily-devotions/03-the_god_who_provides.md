## Wednesday - The God Who Provides

### The Psalm

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:

*as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.*

### The Reading

A reading from

The word of the Lord

*Thanks be to God.*

### The Canticle

God called a man named Abram to follow him.

*Abram and his wife Sarai left their home and followed God.*

God promised Abram that his descendants would be a great nation.

*God promised to bless Abram and make his name great.*

God promised to bless all the families of the earth through them.

*But, Abram and Sarai were old and had no children.*

God change Abram's name to Abraham.

*Abraham means "father of many nations."*

God changed Sarai's name to Sarah.

*Sarah means "princess."*

God sent Abraham and Sarah a son named Isaac.

*Isaac means "laughter."*

The people of Abraham's day worshiped many false gods.

*They would sacrifice animals to try and make their gods happy.*

They would even sacrifice their own children.

*God wanted Abraham to know that He was different.*

One day, God told Abraham to kill and sacrifice his son Isaac.

*Abraham built an altar and tied Isaac to it.*

Abraham raised his knife to kill Isaac.

*God stopped him and provided a ram to sacrifice instead.*

Abraham realized that God is a God who provides.

*Just as God provided that ram, He would someday provide a savior for the world.*

Amen.

### The Lord's Prayer

*Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.*

### The Collect

Lord God, almighty and everlasting Father, you have brought us in safety to this new day: Preserve us with your mighty power, that we may not fall into sin, nor be overcome by adversity; and in all we do, direct us to the fulfilling of your purpose; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
