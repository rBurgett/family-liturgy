## Tuesday - The Promise

### The Psalm

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:

*as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.*

### The Reading

A reading from

The word of the Lord

*Thanks be to God.*

### The Canticle

When God created the world, it was perfect.

*Adam and Eve had no sin.*

God told them not to eat fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

*But they disobeyed.*

When they ate the fruit, they were ashamed and hid from God.

*Sin made them hide from God.*

They tried to cover their shame by wearing fig leaves.

*But they still felt guilty.*

God killed animals to make them clothing.

*Death is the consequence of sin.*

Adam and Even eventually died, but God promised to send a savior.

*Many generations passed and sin filled the earth*

God sent a flood to clean the earth.

*He saved Noah and his family.*

After the flood, God put a rainbow in the sky and made a promise.

*He promised to never flood the earth again.*

But, people continued to sin.

*They built a tower in defiance of God*

God confused their languages and scattered them across the earth.

*But, God never forgot his promise.*

Amen.

### The Lord's Prayer

*Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.*

### The Collect

Lord God, almighty and everlasting Father, you have brought us in safety to this new day: Preserve us with your mighty power, that we may not fall into sin, nor be overcome by adversity; and in all we do, direct us to the fulfilling of your purpose; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
